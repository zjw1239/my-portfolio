        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome! My name is Zach. Currently I am a Bootcamp student learning Web Design.
                Previously I have spent my time in the Trades learning different ways to fix and work on houses and buildings.
                I have worked with many different contractors and learned many different things. I have also spent some time with simple python coding as a hobby.
                I am hoping to make a career change into the Tech world starting with Web Development and wherever life takes me from there.
                In my free time I enjoy video games, longboarding, disc golf and hiking.
            </p>
